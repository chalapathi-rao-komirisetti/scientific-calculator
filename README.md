## Scientific calculator using Python's library Tkinter


Some explanations for each button and the function which represents are the following :

## 1st Row


abs : The absolute value of a number (e.g. abs(-5) = 5).
mod : From modulo. it's the operation to find the remainder of the division of one number by another.
            In python we use the symbol % (e.g. 5mod2 = 5%2 = 1).
div : Floor division returns the result of the division rounded down to the nearest integer.
          In python we use the symbol // (e.g. 8div3 = 8//3 = 2).
x! : The factorial of the number x (e.g. 4! = 24).
e : The Euler's number. A mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.

## 2nd Row


sin : Sine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. sin(90)=1).
cos : Cosine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cos(180)=-1).
tan : Tangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. tan(45)=1).
cot : Cotangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cot(45) = 1/tan(45) = 1).
π : Archimedes' constant defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
       It is approximately equal to 3.14159.

## 3rd Row


x2 : x raised to the power of 2 (e.g. 42 = 16).
x3 : x raised to the power of 3 (e.g. 53 = 125).
xn : x raised to any power (e.g. 24 = 16 ).
x-1 : x raised to the power of (-1). The inverse of number x (e.g. 2-1 = 0.5).
10x : Powers of 10 (e.g. 103 = 1000).
4th Row


2√ : Square root of a number (e.g. 2√144 = 12).
3√ : Cube root of a number (e.g. 3√8 = 2).
√ : Any root of a number (e.g. 4√16 = 2).
log10 : The logarithm of a number with base 10 (e.g. log101000 = 3).
ln : The logarithm of a number with base e (e.g. logee = ln e = 1).

## 5th Row


( : Left parenthesis.
) : Right parenthesis.
± : Change the sign of a number.
% : Find the percentage of a number (e.g. 5% = 0.05).
ex : Expotential function (e.g. e2=approx 7.389 ).

## 6th,7th,8th,9th Row


In these rows are :

-> The basic number buttons (0 to 9).
-> The basic math symbols (operators) (+, -, *, /).
-> The equal sign (=) and point (.).
-> Button DEL to delete one or more from the end of the entry.
-> Button AC to delete the whole entry.
-> EXP : Multiply any number with powers of 10 (e.g. 2 * 10 ** 3 = 2000).
